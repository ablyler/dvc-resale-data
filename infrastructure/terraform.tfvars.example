# Performance Tuning Notes:
#
# For high-volume scraping:
# - Increase scraper_max_pages to 100+
# - Decrease scraper_delay to 0.5
# - Increase batch_size to 50
# - Consider upgrading function_app_sku to EP1
#
# For rate-limit friendly scraping:
# - Increase scraper_delay to 2.0+
# - Decrease scraper_max_pages to 25
# - Keep batch_size at 25 or lower
#
# For development/testing:
# - Set scraper_max_pages to 5-10
# - Set scraper_log_level to "DEBUG"
# - Disable caching: enable_caching = false
